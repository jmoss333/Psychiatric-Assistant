# Setup Instructions

This project is a basic prototype. To run the backend API:

```bash
cd backend
npm install # requires internet access to fetch dependencies
node app.js
```

The mobile app requires React Native CLI or Expo. The web dashboard is a simple static page.

Due to environment constraints, dependencies are not installed in this repository.
